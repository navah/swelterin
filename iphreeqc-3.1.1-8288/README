Building Static Libraries
=========================
     ./configure
     make LDFLAGS=-all-static check
     
   This will attemp to link ALL libraries statically. To be successful all libraries must have .a files.
     

Building Static iphreeqc Library
================================
     ./configure
     make LDFLAGS=-static check
     
   This will link the iphreeqc library statically.  All required additional libraries may be linked to
shared libraries.


Building shared and static iphreeqc Library (linking tests statically)
======================================================================
     ./configure
     make
     make LDFLAGS=-static check       # static to iphreeqc
   or
     make LDFLAGS=-all-static check   # completely static (if possible)
     
   This configuration will create both static and shared (if supported) iphreeqc libraries. But 
test programs (created during make check) will be statically linked to iphreeqc library
